## Answer  
  
**简述瀑布模型、增量模型、螺旋模型（含原型方法）的优缺点。**  
 - waterfall model:  
advantages: 1. provides a relatively linear sequential design approach, which allows engineers to fix bugs in early stages and save time. 2. the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand; it also provides easy identifiable milestones in the development process. 3. fixed, firm and stable. 4. places emphasis on documentation.  
disadvantages: 1. engineers may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs. 2. designers may not be aware of future difficulties.  
  
 - incremental model:  
advantages: 1. after each iteration, regression testing should be conducted. During the testing, faulty elements of the software can be quickly identified because few changes are made within any single iteration. 2. it is generally easier to test and debug than other methods of software development because relatively smaller changes are made during each iteration. this allows for more targeted and rigorous testing of each element within the overall product. 3. customer can respond to features and review the product for any needed or useful changes. 4. initial product delivery is faster and costs less.  
disadvantages: 1. resulting cost may exceed the cost of the organization. 2. as additional functionality is added to the product, problems may arise related to system architecture which were not evident in earlier prototypes.  
  
 - spiral model:  
advantages: 1. high amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of risk is enhanced. 2. good for large and mission-critical projects. 3. strong approval and documentation control. 4. additional functionality can be added at a later date. 5. software is produced early in the software life cycle.  
disadvantages: 1.can be a costly model to use. 2. risk analysis requires highly specific expertise. 3. project's success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase. 4. does not work well for smaller projects.  
     
**简述 UP 的三大特点，其中哪些内容体现了用户驱动的开发，哪些内容体现风险驱动的开发？**  
three characteristics:  
  
 - use case driven: use-case is a prose representation of a sequence of actions, which are performed by one or more actors and the system itself. These actions lead to valuable results for one or more of the actors--helping the actors to achieve their goals. use cases are expressed from the perspective of the users, in natural language, reflecting the concept of user-driven development.  
 - architecture centric: software architecture provides the central point around which all other development evolves. It provides: a big picture of the system; an organization framework for development, evolving the system by attending to modifiability qualities of the system.  
 - iterative and evolutionary: an iterative and evolutionary approach allows start of development with incomplete, importfect knowledge.  
 - According to Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process, actually there is another characteristic of UP: risk-focused. the UP requires the project team to focus on addressing the most critical risks early in the project life cycle. And this emphasizes the concept of risk-driven development.  
  
**UP 四个阶段的划分准则是什么？关键的里程碑是什么？**  
here is an illustration of UP phases:  
![image.png-83.9kB][1]  
The four phases are Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition. They are devided according to four milestones. Actually, a phase could be considered as the period between two certain milestones.  
The Lifecycle Objective Milestone marks the end of the Inception phase.  
The Lifecycle Architecture Milestone marks the end of the Elaboration phase.  
The Initial Operational Milestone marks the end of the Construction phase.  
The Product Release Milestone marks the end of the Transition phase.  
  
**IT 项目管理中，“工期、质量、范围/内容”三个元素中，在合同固定条件下，为什么说“范围/内容”是项目团队是易于控制的**  
workers has a clear idea on the scope/contents, because they are placed on the contract. but they couldn't give a concrete estimation or model about time limit/quality due to their erratic development process.  
  
**为什么说，UP 为企业按固定节奏生产、固定周期发布软件产品提供了依据？**  
The UP provides clear goals and time limits for every phase in processes. At the end of every iteration, there would be an executable release, which reduces the risk of the whole project.
