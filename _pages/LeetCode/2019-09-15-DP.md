## 62. Unique Paths

<https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/>

> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
>
> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

非常基础的动态规划问题。用`dp[i][j]`表示到达`grid[i][j]`的路径数，那么

```python
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
```

```python
def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
	dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
	for i in range(m):
	    for j in range(n):
	        if i == 0 and j == 0:
	            dp[i][j] = 1
	        else:
	            if i > 0:
	                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
	            if j > 0:
	                dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
	return dp[-1][-1]
```

因为这个动态规划的累加是有序的，所以至多用一个一维数组就够了，用来记录`dp[i-1][j]`：

```python
def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
	dp = [0 for _ in range(n)]
	for i in range(m):
	    for j in range(n):
	        if i == 0 and j == 0:
	            dp[j] = 1
	        else:
	            if i > 0:
	                # dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]. do nothing
	                pass
	            if j > 0:
	                dp[j] += dp[j-1]
	return dp[-1]
```
